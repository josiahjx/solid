        {
          question: "What is cryptocurrency recovery?",
          answer: "Cryptocurrency recovery is the process of attempting to regain access to lost, stolen, or inaccessible digital assets. This can include recovering private keys, tracing stolen funds, or helping with legal recovery processes."
        },
        {
          question: "How much does recovery cost?",
          answer: "We operate on a 'No Recovery, No Fee' basis. Initial consultations are always free, and we only charge if we successfully recover your assets. Fees are typically a percentage of recovered funds, agreed upon upfront."
        },
        {
          question: "What is your success rate?",
          answer: "Our success rate is approximately 95% for cases we accept. However, not all cases are recoverable. We provide honest assessments during initial consultations about the likelihood of success."
        },
        {
          question: "How long does recovery take?",
          answer: "Recovery time varies significantly based on the complexity of the case. Simple cases might take days, while complex ones can take weeks or months. We provide timeline estimates during initial assessment."

          answer: "Yes, we can help reconstruct or recover seed phrases through various methods. This is often more successful than direct private key recovery."
        },
        {
          question: "Is it safe to share my wallet information?",
